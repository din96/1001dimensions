# Hi! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Emilia, a Berlin-based Product Designer. I am passionate about my work and proudly serve people through design, utilizing my experience and unique skill set. By connecting with people, understanding their desires, and what brings them value, my motivation is embedded with empathizing and focusing on user needs to design and produce sustainable solutions.

## About this page
This page presents some of my projects demonstrating my skills in **product design, user experience, and data analytics**. I have chosen the most recent and favorite projects from my portfolio.

My goal was to have full control over the appearance and functionality of this website. I also wanted to ensure a simple and pleasant browsing and reading experience. I opted for a minimal design based on Inter typeface family and used Jupyter Book and the Sphinx Design extension, as they are ideal tools for generating static documentation pages. I hope you enjoy your visit! ðŸ‘€
