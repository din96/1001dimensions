## About this page
This page presents some of my projects demonstrating my skills in **product design, user experience, and data analytics**. I have chosen the most recent and favorite projects from my portfolio.

My goal was to have full control over the appearance and functionality of this website. I also wanted to ensure a simple and pleasant browsing and reading experience. I opted for a minimal design based on Inter typeface family and used Jupyter Book and the Sphinx Design extension, as they are ideal tools for generating static documentation pages. I hope you enjoy your visit! ðŸ‘€
